# Weather Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on classifying different weather conditions using Machine Learning.
The model is trained on weather-related data and predicts the weather category based on input features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Data loading
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction

## Dataset
The dataset contains weather-related attributes used to classify weather conditions.
